     1. Max product: Given an array with both positive and negative integers, return a pair with the highest product.

     2. Coin Change: Given a set of coins and a total money amount. Write a method to compute the smallest number of coins to make up the given amount. If the amount cannot be made up by any combination of the given coins, return -1.

     For example:
     Given [4, 5, 10] and amount=6, the method should return -1.
     Given [1, 2, 5] and amount=7, the method should return 2.

     Given [1, 4, 5, 10] and amount=8, the method should return 2.
